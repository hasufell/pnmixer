version 0.7:
 - PNMixer went through a major rewrite !
   The new code share little with the previous 0.6 version
 - New translations: Simplified Chinese
 - Icon theme is now more restrictive and more usable
   (user can choose between system icon theme, or PNMixer icon theme)
 - Volume change improvements:
	- 2 steps are configurable: fine and normal
	- they apply to every way of changing volume: keyboard, mouse, hotkeys.
	  (before, there was still some hard-coded steps here and there)
	- fine-grained (decimal) steps are now possible
	  (some USB DACs need such fine tuning)
 - Volume popup orientation is now configurable (horizontal or vertical)
 - Debug messages are now available using the `-d` command-line option
   (no need to rebuild PNMixer anymore)

	- use 'intltool' instead of 'glib-gettext' to handle translations
	- desktop file is now translated and part of POTFILES
 - Better handling of USB soundcards that are unplugged:
 	- A notification is sent
	- Another soundcard in the list (starting with the default) is opened,
	  so that PNMixer is still usable and useful
	- If USB card is re-plugged afterward, one should click 'Reload Alsa'

Thursday 03 September 2009 -

Changes from the previous version;

 - This application now interfaces with ALSA rather than OSS as
   the oss mixer device will not allow access to theu range of
   the Master volume channel in future versions of ubuntu.
 - As interfacing with ALSA slows the application down, volume
   changes now only take affect when the scale is released.

Friday 28 August 2009 -

Initial version created/realesed based on the code from AbsVolume,
which was written by Paul Sherman and Rob Eberts.

Changes from the previous program which have taken place include;

 - New UI similar to gnomes mixer applet.
 - New callbacks such as close/hide when focus is lost.
 - Mixer now uses the master control to enable compatibility
   with pulse audio as well as alsa.
 - New Icons which indicate if mute is enabled
 - Program now calls pavucontrol rather than alsa mixer but
   this will be configurable in future versions.
